Textured parametric surfaces in OpenSCAD

This library allows you to create textured 3D objects in OpenSCAD.

The objects are defined as [parametric surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_surface), i.e., a mathematical function defines the shape.
The textures are 2D arrays, where each value represents a bump in the surface.
